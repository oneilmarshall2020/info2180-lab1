        <p>A little bit about me. I aspire to change the world with the software that I will create and of course getting
          a good grade on this course will only aid those ambitions. 
          I am interested in web development simply because I am fascinated with technology and instead of being in tune with my creative 
          side as my expertise with sports might suggest, I tend to lean on the left side of my brain a bit too much. So I think this is a 
          great way to get the wheels turning in the right side of my brain.
